description: >-
  Validate, deploy, and manage applications on a Coolify VPS via the
  atelier-coolify CLI. Use when the operator asks to deploy a project, check a
  deployment's status, read deploy logs, diagnose or fix a failed deployment,
  set environment variables, or create/delete an app on the VPS.

# Coolify

`atelier-coolify` is a thin client for the Coolify v1 API. It reads
`COOLIFY_API_TOKEN` and `COOLIFY_BASE_URL` from the current project's `.env`
(kept gitignored by atelier's `.env*` guardrail) or from the environment, so one
operator can deploy different projects to different instances. Run
`atelier-coolify --help` for the full reference.

## Working directory matters — check before you conclude "not configured"

`atelier-coolify` resolves `.env` **relative to its own process cwd**, with no
upward search and no awareness of worktrees or multi-project workspaces. Your
`Bash` cwd is whatever the session inherited (often the workspace root, a
sibling project, or a task worktree) — **not necessarily the project whose
Coolify app you're working with.** A "COOLIFY_BASE_URL not set" error from the
wrong cwd is not evidence that Coolify is unconfigured.

Before running any `atelier-coolify` command, or telling the operator Coolify
needs setup:

1. Identify the actual project root — the repo whose app you're
   validating/deploying — and target the CLI at it explicitly: either
   `cd <project-root> && atelier-coolify ...`, or
   `COOLIFY_ENV_FILE=<project-root>/.env atelier-coolify ...`.
2. If a call still fails, check that project's own `.env` yourself —
   `grep -c '^COOLIFY_' <project-root>/.env` — before asking the operator.
   Never print the token value.
3. Only report Coolify as unconfigured, and only ask the operator for the
   URL/token, if that specific project's `.env` genuinely lacks them after
   step 2. Do not ask the operator to open Coolify in a browser to read out
   values you have not first checked for in `.env`.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `atelier-coolify list` | List applications and their UUIDs |
| `atelier-coolify status <uuid>` | Application status |
| `atelier-coolify logs <uuid> [lines]` | Recent logs |
| `atelier-coolify deployments` | Running deployments |
| `atelier-coolify validate <uuid>` | Status + logs if unhealthy (exit 2 on failure) |
| `atelier-coolify deploy-mode <uuid>` | Report cached/known deploy mode; live API reads return `unknown` |
| `atelier-coolify deploy <uuid> [--force]` | Trigger a deployment |
| `atelier-coolify set-env <uuid> KEY=VALUE` | Upsert an env var |
| `atelier-coolify create-app-public … [--yes]` | Create an app (operator confirmation; prompts unless `--yes`) |
| `atelier-coolify delete-app <uuid> [--yes]` | Delete an app (operator confirmation; prompts for the uuid unless `--yes`) |

## Know how the app deploys before triggering anything

Many apps are wired through Coolify's GitHub App so that a push to the watched
branch **auto-deploys**. However, Coolify's application API does not currently
expose that flag to this plugin, so a live `deploy-mode <uuid>` cannot prove
whether an app is auto or manual:

- `deploy_mode: "auto"` — a `git push`/merge to `watched_branch` **is** the
  deploy. This only appears from an operator-confirmed cache override.
- `deploy_mode: "manual"` — run `deploy <uuid>` yourself after the code lands.
- `deploy_mode: "unknown"` — live API reads land here because the flag is not
  exposed. Treat as manual and tell the operator the mode could not be
  confirmed.

`deploy-mode` caches the result per project (`.coolify-deploy-mode.json`), so it
is resolved once, not re-assumed every run. If the operator knows an app is
auto-deployed, they can hand-edit that cache entry to set
`{"deploy_mode":"auto"}` for the app uuid; the CLI honors the cached entry until
`--refresh` re-queries the API and returns to `unknown`.

## Validate-and-fix flow

1. `list` → find the app UUID. `deploy-mode <uuid>` → read cached/known mode.
2. `validate <uuid>` — if it exits non-zero, read the logs it prints.
3. Diagnose from the logs (missing env var, build failure, wrong branch).
4. Apply the fix:
   - **Code fix:** if `auto`, push/merge to the watched branch — that deploys;
     do **not** call `deploy`. If `manual`, land the code then `deploy <uuid>`.
   - **Config fix (`set-env`):** always `deploy <uuid>` afterwards, even on
     `auto` apps — `set-env` writes through the API, not git, so auto-deploy
     does not fire for it.
5. `validate <uuid>` again to confirm the deployment is healthy.

## Rules

- Resolve the target app with `list` first; never guess a UUID.
- Check `deploy-mode` before triggering a deploy on a code change. Treat
  `unknown` as manual; only skip `deploy` when the cache explicitly says
  `auto`.
- `create-app-public` and `delete-app` are not in the allowlist — confirm with
  the operator before running them. They also confirm in-CLI: without `--yes`,
  `create-app-public` asks y/N and `delete-app` requires typing the app uuid
  back (both need a TTY; non-interactive runs die unless `--yes` is passed).
  Pass `--yes` only after the operator has explicitly approved that exact
  operation.
- After `set-env`, a `deploy` is required for the change to take effect (this
  holds even on auto-deploy apps).
